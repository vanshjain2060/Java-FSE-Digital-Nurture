Concept
    recursion is basically one function calls itself to solve a smaller part of the same problem, means by breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems until a base case is reached.
    Recursion is useful in problems that have perticular recursive structure, such as tree traversals, sorting algorithms etc.

    Recursive Soultion contains of two essential parts:
        - BaseCase :- this is the simplest problem which can be directly solved without any further recursive calls.
        - RecursiveCalls :- function calling itself to break the problem into simpler form.

How Recursion Simplifies problems
    - Breaking down problems into smaller onces
    - having more cleaner code structure
    - used Divide and Conquer Approach
    - Straight forward implementation of problem
