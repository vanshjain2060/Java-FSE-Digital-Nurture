Time Complexity of Recursive algorithms deppends on 
    - Number of Recursive calls
    - Work Done in each call
    - how recursive calls form a tree of operations
 
Here are come common recursive time complexities 
    - O(n) for Linear Recursion
    - O(log n) for Logarithmic
    - O(n log n) for Divide and Conqure algorithms
    - O(2^n) Expontial recursion
    - o(n!) BruteForce

Ways to Optimizing Recursive Solutions 
    - Memoization in which we basically try to strore the solution of the problems which are computed previously to reduce the redundent calculations
    - Dynamic Programming includes using both topdown and bottomUp approach to solve recursive problems more effectively
    - Pruning like avoid exploring branches that cannot lead to void Solutions
